# Modified-Shakura-Sunayev-models
<br> 2023 Kristian Vitovsky
<br> These codes compute modified Shakura-Sunayev models for circumstellar discs.
<br> If they were to be used for a different system than the Beta Lyrae A accretion disc, many constants must be changed. The plotting section should be double-checked.
<br> There are more comments in the Pgas version, but all three codes (Prad, PgapproxPr) follow the structure. 
<br> The models are fully described in my Master's Thesis: https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/179554
<br> Some of the functions and plots reference a paper by my supervisor doc. Mgr. Miroslav Bro≈æ, Ph.D.: https://sirrah.troja.mff.cuni.cz/~mira/betalyr/
